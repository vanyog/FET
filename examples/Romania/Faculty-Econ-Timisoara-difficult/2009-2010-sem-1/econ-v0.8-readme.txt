Sample Faculty Economics Timisoara, 2009-2010-sem1.

Times are written for GNU/Linux, AMD dual core 4000+.

This sample is very difficult. may solve in 2 hours or not solve at all (>12h), depends on luck.

A timetable is indeed possible even if adding constraint students set max gaps per day=1 (in 2 hours if lucky), but again depends on luck, it may never solve.
