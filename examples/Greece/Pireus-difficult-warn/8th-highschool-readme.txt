A difficult file, may take 20 minutes or even more (on an AMD 64 dual core 4000+, openSuse GNU/Linux).

You'll get some messages about ignored constraints and using not perfect constraints - if you pass the ignored constraints
and select Yes (continue) for the message referring to not perfect constraints you'll be able to start the generation of a timetable.

Explanation: this file has some activities inactivated, and this is why some constraints related to these activities are now useless
and FET reports this. Also, this file uses not perfect constraints of type activity tag max hours daily, and this is why you get a warning.
